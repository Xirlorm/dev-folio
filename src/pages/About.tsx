        <h2>üßë‚Äçüíª Who I am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a self-taught frontend developer driven by perseverance and
          curiosity. My passion for programming began in high school, paused
          after graduation, and reignited...without even having a PC.
          <br />
          <br />
          To keep learning, I turned to Termux, running Arch Linux on my Android
          phone with just 1GB of RAM and a quadcore processor. That persistence
          led to my first frontend job, and eventually, my first PC.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether I'm crafting sleek interfaces or exploring new tech, I
          genuinely enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional code. There's
          nothing quite like seeing your thoughts come to life on screen.
        </p>
        <Note>
          I'm currently open to new opportunities, feel free to{" "}

          Here's a look at the tools I use and those I'm currently exploring:

        <h2>üß† My creative process</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes I sketch out ideas on paper, other times I dive right into
          code... I let the moment guide me. When I hit the wall, I either do
          some research if needed or take a break to clear my mind. A walk or
          some memes usually helps and I often return with a new perspective(or
          a lucky guess that works). It can be a cycle but I eventually figure
          it out.
          <br />
          <br /> When inspiration runs dry, I turn to Pinterest for design
          ideas. It helps get the gears turning, but I always aim to create
          something original.

        <h2>üé® Outside of code</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond programming, I enjoy exploring and learning 3D modeling in
          Blender, learning to create digital art in GIMP which I hope would
          improve my works in web development, and experimenting with music in
          LMMS. I love expressing creativity across different mediums.
